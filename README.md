#IPv6 Validator Regex

This repository documents a regular expression (regex) that checks an IPv6 address for the proper format. It has four files:

**ipv6validator.js**

A Javascript that takes the IPv6 address from the web page and checks to see that it is well-formed. 

**IPv6AddressValidator.html** and
**mibprobebuilder.css**

The web page and CSS file that invoke the Javascript above.

**test-ipv6-regex.pl**

A perl program that tests the regex against almost 500 (included) test cases.
