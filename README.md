#IPv6 Validator Regex

This repository documents a regular expression (regex) that checks an IPv6 address for the proper format. It has four files:

**ipv6validator.js**

A Javascript that takes the IPv6 address from the web page and checks to see that it is well-formed. 

*IPv6AddressValidator.html* and
*mibprobebuilder.css*

The web page and CSS file that invoke the Javascript above.

*test-ipv6-regex.pl*

A perl program that tests the regex against almost 500 test cases.
